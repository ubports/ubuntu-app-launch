This documents the expections that the project has on what both submitters
and reviewers should ensure that they've done for a merge into the project.

== Submitter Responsibilities ==

 * Ensure the project compiles and the test suite executes without error
 * Ensure that non-obvious code has comments explaining it

== Reviewer Responsibilities ==

 * Did the Jenkins build compile?  Pass?  Run unit tests successfully?
 * Are there appropriate tests to cover any new functionality?
 * If this MR effects application startup:
   * Where you able to test starting a click app?  (i.e. clock)
   * Where you able to test starting a legacy app?  (i.e. system settings)
   * Where you able to test secondary activation? (i.e. system settings running, settings item from an indicator)
